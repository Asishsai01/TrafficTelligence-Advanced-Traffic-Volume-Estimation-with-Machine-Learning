# 🚦 TrafficTelligence: Advanced Traffic Volume Estimation with Machine Learning

**TrafficTelligence** is a machine learning-powered solution designed to estimate and predict traffic volume using historical and real-time data. This project is ideal for smart city infrastructure, traffic management systems, and researchers exploring transportation analytics.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Urban traffic congestion is a growing issue globally. **TrafficTelligence** tackles this challenge by using machine learning algorithms to analyze traffic data, detect patterns, and make accurate volume predictions based on various features like time, weather, and location.

---

## 🔍 Objectives

- Estimate current and future traffic volume accurately
- Analyze traffic patterns and trends using data visualization
- Build and compare ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, etc.)
- Provide a reusable pipeline for training and prediction
- Enable integration with real-time data sources for deployment
